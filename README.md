# Recommendation System for Supermarkets

This project focuses on building and analyzing recommendation systems for supermarket transaction data
The goal is to model customer purchasing behavior and generate meaningful product recommendations using machine learning methods

## Project Overview

The project explores recommendation techniques on real-world-like retail transaction data, including:

- preprocessing large-scale transaction datasets
- representation learning for users and items
- training recommendation models
- evaluating recommendation quality

The repository contains **code only**. Large datasets and trained models are intentionally excluded from version control

## Methods & Models

Depending on experiments, the project include:

- Autoencoder-based recommendation models
- Sequential or representation-based approaches
